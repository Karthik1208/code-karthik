    <h1 id="shoot">Shooter</h1>
    <p>In shooter games (or simply shooters), players use ranged weapons to participate in the action, which takes place at a distance.[2] Most shooters involve violent gameplay; lethal weaponry is used to damage opponents. However, some shooters, such as Splatoon, have non-violent objectives.</p>
    <p>Shooters, aside from subgenre classifications, can be further classified by their perspective of play. First-person shooters are played within the protagonist's perspective; they often include a heads-up display showing key information such as the current health of the protagonist.[7][8] In third-person shooters, the protagonist's body can be seen fully; the environment is rendered from a distance.[8] Some shooters incorporate both perspectives.</p>
